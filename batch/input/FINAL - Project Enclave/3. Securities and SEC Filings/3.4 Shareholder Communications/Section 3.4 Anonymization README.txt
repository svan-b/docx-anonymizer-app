Section 3.4: Anonymization README

Maria Briski  

All of the documents in this section are directly from Enclave.  

After compiling all information for this section, I found any possible identifiers, no matter how small. These are cataloged in total in the file "Section 3.4_Box Identifiers." 

I then took the total population of possible identifiers and mapped them against the critical identifiers in the "Anonymization_Tracker_Enclave.docx" listed under "AGREED ALIASES." 

All files in this directory are PDF, anonymization remains outstanding.
