Section 1: Anonymization README

Maria Briski  

All of the documents in this section have a basis in actual data from Enclave, compiled from filings, IR data, etc.  

After compiling all information for this section, I found any possible identifiers, no matter how small. These are cataloged in total in the file "Section 1_Box Identifiers." 

I then took the total population of possible identifiers and mapped them against the critical identifiers in the "Anonymization_Tracker_Enclave.docx" listed under "AGREED ALIASES." 

Documents were then edited to anonymize where possible (docx, org charts) for critical identifiers. PDF files remain outstanding.
